##Final Project Proposal

# What will likely be the title of your project?
"www.julianhootmusic.com" will likely be the title of my project.

# In just a sentence or two, summarize your project.
My final project will be a website dedicated to showcasing my various works and projects as a musician. 
This will serve as a great networking tool for me in the future.

# List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project.
1. The code alongs from class
2. YouTube tutorials
3. Peer review (asking my classmates to check my code)

# In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
My project will be a website that will put my various projects on display for people to see. My website will have multiple pages. 
One will be a home page, with pictures of myself, my performances, and my projects. I also intend to put a short artist bio/statement here.
Another page will be dedicated to media. It will feature embeded songs and videos for visitors to watch and interact with. 
I want to put a 'contact' page on my site as well. Ideally, this will be a message box that people can write in and use to inquire work, 
that will be sent directly to my business email. Lastly, I'd like to include a page with all my links to socials and things.
I intend to code for my website using HTML.

# Will any work as part of this project overlap with any work you are doing outside of this class?
Yes. I intend to develop my website as my final project for this class as well as my LHUM-400 (Professional Development Seminar) class. My Professor is Tom Schmidt.

# Good outcome (what I will accomplish no matter what)
- home page with pictures and an artist bio
- media page with at least one embeded song and video
- links page with all of my socials

# Better outcome (What I think I can accomplish)
- home page with pictures and an artist bio
- media page with a couple songs and videos
- links page with all of my socials
- contact page with my contact info

# Best outcome (What I hope to accomplish)
- home page with pictures and an artist bio
- media page with a couple songs and videos
- links page with all of my socials
- contact page with my contact info and working message box linked to my business email
- visual elements that engage the visitor (buttons that change color when clicking/hovering, the page changes as you scroll, etc)

# Project Outline
Within the next week (4/10 - 4/17) I hope to compile materials for my website. This includes the songs that I have worked on, as well as the pictures from performances that I have been a part of. In the following week (4/17 - 4/24), I hope to start learning HTML and begin researching platforms for developing my website. Once I have found a platform to develop my website on, I will begin coding. The week after, (4/24 - 5/1) I hope to make the bulk of my progress in coding/implementing features. In the final week (5/1 - 5/8), I hope to finalize my features and add in any embelishments or finishing touches that make the website shine. An idea that comes to mind are visual details that engage the visitor and/or make my website look more professional (i.e. buttons change color when you hover over them or click them).
