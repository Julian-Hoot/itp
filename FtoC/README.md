# Farenheit to Celsius Converter

## What I did
first I created a variable for farenheit, "f"
then I created the variable for celsius, "c"
the celsius variable was set equal to the conversion equation
lastly I console logged the celsius variable so the program would output the conversion

## ABDYD!
when first trying to implement the coversion equation into the program, I had the wrong syntax
I used { } instead of ( ) for the equation at first, I did this because I saw squigly brackets being used in a function at some point in the code along, so I thought thats what I should use, but it was for a different kind of command (I forgot what it was called)
I also forgot to poperly space the operations, meaning I put "(5/9)" instead of "(5 / 9)"

## My Code
`
let f = 99;
let c = (f - 32) * (5 / 9);
console.log(c);
`
