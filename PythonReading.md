# Python Reading

## The Way of the Program
- One thing I already knew (or could assume) is that Python has operators
- One thing I did not know is that Python is designed to be easy for humans to read and write (and that this is called a high-level language)

## Functions
- I knew that Python has functions with inputs and outputs (return values)
- I did not know much about the syntax of them; I did not know you have to call the function by name, or use an import statement for modules

## Conditionals and Recrusion
- I knew that Python has logical operators
- I did not know that you can extract ending digits of a number by doing X mod 10, or X mod 100, etc.

## Lists
- I knew (assumed) you could put both number values and strings in a list
- I did not know you could nest lists
