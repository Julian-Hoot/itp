# Javascript Reading


## Chapter 1
I knew that javascript has a 64 bit integer limit
I did not know that you can use infinity and -infinity in your computations

## Chapter 2
I knew that the environment is the context in which the program and its bindings exist
I did not know what bindings are and how computers use them to remember certain values

## Chapter 3
The only thing I did know already from this chapter is that functions exist in javascript/coding in general
I did not know that certain bindings, depending on where they are placed, will be global or local
