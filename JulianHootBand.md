# Julian Hoot Band Website Group Project
Group members: Zoe, Sebastian, Annie Z

## What we did
We made a website for a fake emo band called "Finding Emo". We started by generating a band logo image using chatgpt
and then put a stock photo of an emo band on the website. Then we used Zoe's personal github.io website for our band website.
Zoe started implementing things into the website by copying the html code from Professor Rome's example website.
We all wrote/generated our own personal member bios and sent them to Zoe to put in the index.html file.
Next we decided to implement a hyperlink to "stream our album" (it is actually a rick roll).
Zoe also made the rick roll work as an embeded audio file that is playable on the website.

Next, we created a css file in order to center our images, change the background and text color, and format our website.
Zoe also created a navigation bar for our website. There is a "home" page and a "bios" page. Zoe separated the relevant assets onto each page.

## Problems we faced
Lots and of typos caused us to second guess ourselves ("rick-roll.mp3" instead of "Rick-roll.mp3" caused our embdeded file to not work).
It took a little bit of time for the website to update after each change we made, so we had to cross check the website on all of our computers.

## My contributions
I helped a lot with the visual formatting aspects (background color and text color, making sure things are aligned and look nice). I also had the
idea to put the rick roll on the website.

## My group's contributions
Zoe did pretty much all of the coding with the html and css files. Annie and Sebastian generated bios and images for the website and bounced
ideas around with the band lore and other things.
